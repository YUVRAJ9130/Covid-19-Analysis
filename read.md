# COVID-19 ANALYSIS USING SQL AND VISUALIZATION USING TABLEAU

Covid-19 pandemic was a really serious outbreak that cost lives and affected the economy negatively, thus, public communication is needed for the audience and the government to make impactful decisions on this pandemic. The Covid-19 dataset is updated daily and can be found on various websites, but I got the daily updated dataset on this website; https://bit.ly/3LmfAAG . The dataset used for this project recorded cases from 24th February 2020 to 2nd April 2021.

I explored this using MSSQL and made dashboards and visualizations using Tableau. The method and processes will be explored in this article.

The dataset contains details of columns on cases, deaths, and vaccinations. For simplicity, I decided to split the dataset into two forms with Excel: CovidDeaths, and CovidVaccinations. The CovidDeaths dataset contained columns and records on cases, and deaths while the CovidVaccinations dataset contains only columns and rows regarding vaccinations and tests. This whole SQL project was executed on the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, Below is a snapshot of a few of the columns and entries in the CovidDeaths, CovidVaccinations dataset, the SQL query file will be available on my Github Repo: https://github.com/YUVRAJ9130/Covid-19-Analysis

This project was performed using Microsoft SQL Server, It focuses on using SQL for exploratory data analysis and querying of the Covid-19 data, which was split into two datasets; Covid Deaths and Covid Vaccinations. It comprises covid records from February 2020 to April 2021. The idea behind this project is to get information and insights into the Covid-19 impact in the world.
